# Introduction

Apache Airflow is an open-source platform designed to programmatically author, schedule, and monitor workflows. It enables users to define workflows as code, making it highly versatile and scalable for orchestrating complex processes.

### **Use Cases**

Airflow is widely used for:

* **ETL/ELT Pipelines** : Extracting, transforming, and loading data efficiently.
* **Infrastructure Management** : Managing resources dynamically based on needs.
* **Machine Learning Operations (MLOps)** : Orchestrating the lifecycle of machine learning models.
* **Business Applications** : Supporting data-driven applications for various industries.

### **History**

Airflow was initially developed by Airbnb in 2014 to address the challenges of managing workflows in data engineering. It later became an Apache Software Foundation project, gaining widespread adoption due to its flexibility and community-driven development.

### **Key Benefits**

* **Flexibility** : Define workflows in Python, allowing for complex logic and integrations.
* **Scalability** : Handle workflows of varying sizes and complexities.
* **Community Support** : Benefit from a robust ecosystem of plugins and active contributors.
* **Monitoring** : Track and visualize workflows in real-time.

# **Architecture Overview**

Airflow operates on a  **distributed architecture** , where tasks are executed across multiple nodes. Workflows are defined as Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAGs), which outline the sequence and dependencies of tasks.

### **Key Components**

1. **Scheduler** :

* The Scheduler is responsible for triggering tasks based on their dependencies and schedules.
* It assigns tasks to executors, ensuring they run in the correct order.

1. **Web Server** :

* The Web Server provides a user-friendly interface to monitor, manage, and debug workflows.
* It allows users to visualize DAGs, check task statuses, and trigger workflows manually.

1. **Workers** :

* Workers execute the tasks assigned by the Scheduler.
* They can be scaled horizontally to handle large workloads, making Airflow highly scalable.

1. **Metadata Database** :

* The Metadata Database stores information about workflows, task states, and execution logs.
* It acts as the central repository for all Airflow components to interact and maintain consistency.

# **Installation & Setup of Apache Airflow**

Apache Airflow can be installed and set up using various methods, depending on your environment and requirements. Here's an overview:

---

#### **Installing via pip**

* Airflow can be installed using Python's package manager, `pip`.
* A typical command for installation looks like this:
  ```bash
  pip install "apache-airflow[celery]==<version>" --constraint "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/apache/airflow/constraints-<version>/constraints-<python_version>.txt"
  ```
* It's recommended to use a virtual environment (e.g., `venv`) for isolation and dependency management.

---

#### **Installing via Docker**

* Airflow provides an **[Airflow Docker Link](https://airflow.apache.org/docs/apache-airflow/2.10.5/howto/docker-compose/index.html)** for containerized deployment:
* You can use Docker Compose to set up Airflow quickly. Fetch the `docker-compose.yaml` file and run:
  ```bash
  docker-compose up -d
  ```
* This method is ideal for testing and development environments.

---

#### **Airflow UI Overview**

* The Airflow UI is a web-based interface that allows users to:
  * Visualize DAGs (Directed Acyclic Graphs).
  * Monitor task statuses and logs.
  * Trigger workflows manually.
  * Debug and manage workflows interactively.
* It provides a clear and intuitive way to manage workflows, making it a powerful tool for orchestration.
