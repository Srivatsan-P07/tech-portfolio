# WorkFlows

### 1. **Branching**

Branching in Airflow lets you execute specific paths in your workflow based on a condition. It is implemented using the `BranchPythonOperator`, where you can define the logic to choose which task or tasks should run next.

Here’s an example of using the `BranchPythonOperator` to demonstrate branching logic in Airflow:

```python
from datetime import datetime
from airflow import DAG
from airflow.operators.python import BranchPythonOperator
from airflow.operators.dummy import DummyOperator

# Function to determine which branch to follow
def choose_branch():
    # Example logic: Branch based on a condition
    return "task_a" if datetime.now().hour < 12 else "task_b"

# Define the DAG
with DAG(dag_id="branch_example", start_date=datetime(2023, 4, 1), schedule_interval="@daily", catchup=False) as dag:
    # Start task
    start = DummyOperator(task_id="start")

    # Branching logic
    branching = BranchPythonOperator(
        task_id="branching",
        python_callable=choose_branch,
    )

    # Define downstream tasks
    task_a = DummyOperator(task_id="task_a")
    task_b = DummyOperator(task_id="task_b")

    # End tasks
    end_a = DummyOperator(task_id="end_a")
    end_b = DummyOperator(task_id="end_b")

    # Define dependencies
    start >> branching
    branching >> task_a >> end_a
    branching >> task_b >> end_b
```

* The `choose_branch` function checks the current time and decides whether to go to `task_a` or `task_b`.
* The `BranchPythonOperator` uses this function to determine which downstream tasks to execute.
* You might check a file’s presence and branch to different tasks based on its existence.
* Any tasks not chosen in the branch are effectively skipped.
* Use `None` for downstream tasks you don't want to execute in certain paths.

 **Tip** : Ensure all possible downstream tasks are reachable so the DAG doesn't fail due to "no task dependencies."

### 2. **Task Groups**

Task groups help organize tasks within a DAG by grouping related tasks, which makes your workflows visually cleaner in the Airflow UI. They’re ideal for grouping repetitive or modular processes (e.g., data extraction, transformation, and loading).

 **Key Features** :

* Easily view and manage grouped tasks as a single block.
* Leverage the `TaskGroup` class in Airflow 2.x+.

 **Example Usage** :

```python
from airflow.utils.task_group import TaskGroup

with TaskGroup("group_name") as tg:
    task1 = DummyOperator(task_id="task1")
    task2 = DummyOperator(task_id="task2")
    task1 >> task2

start_task >> tg
```

### 3. **Cross-DAG Dependencies**

Sometimes workflows span across multiple DAGs. In such cases, you can create dependencies between them using **ExternalTaskSensor** or  **TriggerDagRunOperator** . This ensures one DAG waits for or triggers another.

 **Scenarios** :

* DAG A needs to finish before DAG B starts.
* Modular DAGs handle separate parts of a workflow, but one depends on another.

---

### 4. **Conditional Workflows**

These workflows dynamically adjust the execution path based on conditions such as time, external states, or computation results.

Tools for conditional workflows:

* `BranchPythonOperator`
* `ShortCircuitOperator` (halts execution of downstream tasks if a condition fails)
* Jinja Templating in task arguments (to parameterize task execution).

---

### 5. **Best Practices**

To optimize and maintain your Airflow workflows:

* **Structure DAGs Clearly** : Break large workflows into modular, reusable components with TaskGroups or separate DAGs.
* **Test DAGs** : Validate your DAG logic before deploying using the `airflow dags test` command.
* **Use Retry Mechanisms** : Add retries and delays to handle transient failures gracefully.
* **Parameterize DAGs** : Make workflows reusable by passing parameters via variables or configuration files.
* **Limit DAG Complexity** : Avoid creating overly complex DAGs—use smaller DAGs connected through cross-DAG dependencies.
* **Documentation** : Provide clear descriptions for tasks and DAGs for team collaboration and troubleshooting.
