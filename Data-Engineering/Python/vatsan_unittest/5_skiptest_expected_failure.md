In Python's `unittest` module, you can use decorators like `@unittest.skip`, `@unittest.expectedFailure`, and conditional skipping to control the behavior of tests in specific scenarios. Here's how they work:

### 1. **Skipping Tests**

Skipping tests is useful when certain tests are not relevant or cannot be run in a particular environment.

* **`@unittest.skip(reason)`**

  Skips the decorated test method, regardless of any conditions.

  Example:

  ```python
  import unittest

  class MyTestCase(unittest.TestCase):
      @unittest.skip("Skipping this test")
      def test_skipped(self):
          self.assertEqual(1, 2)
  ```

  The reason provided (e.g., `"Skipping this test"`) will appear in the test output.
* **`@unittest.skipIf(condition, reason)`**

  Skips the test if the condition evaluates to `True`.

  Example:

  ```python
  @unittest.skipIf(condition=sys.platform == "win32", reason="Doesn't run on Windows")
  def test_not_on_windows(self):
      ...
  ```
* **`@unittest.skipUnless(condition, reason)`**

  Skips the test unless the condition evaluates to `True`.

  Example:

  ```python
  @unittest.skipUnless(condition=sys.version_info >= (3, 8), reason="Requires Python 3.8 or higher")
  def test_requires_new_python(self):
      ...
  ```

### 2. **Marking Expected Failures**

Use `@unittest.expectedFailure` when a test is currently expected to fail due to known bugs or unfinished features. This lets you track issues without breaking the test suite.

Example:

```python
@unittest.expectedFailure
def test_known_bug(self):
    self.assertEqual(function_with_bug(), expected_result)
```

If the test passes, the framework will report it as an "unexpected success," signaling that the issue might be resolved.

---

### 3. **Conditional Skipping in Code**

If you need more complex logic for skipping tests, use the `self.skipTest(reason)` method inside your test method.

Example:

```python
def test_custom_skip_logic(self):
    if some_condition:
        self.skipTest("Skipping due to custom logic")
    self.assertEqual(1, 1)
```

These features help you maintain flexibility in your test suite, accommodating diverse environments or incomplete features without failing unnecessarily.
