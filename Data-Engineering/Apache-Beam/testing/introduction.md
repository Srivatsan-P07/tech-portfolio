# Introduction to Testing Tools
Apache Beam offers several tools and classes for testing pipelines24:

- **TestPipeline** : A class used for creating test pipelines. It handles setting up pipeline options internally.
- **PAssert** : A class for making assertions on the contents of a PCollection, verifying that it contains the expected elements.
- **Create Transform** : Used to create a PCollection from in-memory data, which can then be used as input for tests.
