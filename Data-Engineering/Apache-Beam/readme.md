**ðŸš€ Prerequisites**
----------------

- Python 3.9.0
- Basic understanding of data processing
- Familiarity with GCP (optional but helpful)

**ðŸ§  Tips for Learning**
--------------------

- Start with simple batch jobs before jumping into streaming.
- Use **`DirectRunner`** locally, and test often.
- Always think in terms of transforms and PCollections.
- Explore **`Apache Beam` documentation for deeper dives.
