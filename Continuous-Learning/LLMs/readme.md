| 1. Introduction to Large Language Models (LLMs) | What are LLMs? Evolution of LLMs (GPT, BERT, T5, LLaMA, PaLM). Differences between NLP, Transformers, and LLMs. Applications of LLMs.                                                               |
| 2. Setting Up the Environment                   | Installing required libraries: Hugging Face transformers, langchain, openai, torch, sentence-transformers. Setting up Jupyter Notebook/Colab for experimentation.                                   |
| 3. Transformer Architecture & How LLMs Work     | Understanding Self-Attention and Multi-Head Attention. Positional encoding and tokenization. Differences between Encoder-Decoder (BERT vs GPT).                                                     |
| 4. Using Pre-trained LLMs                       | Loading models from Hugging Face (GPT-2, GPT-3, T5, Falcon, LLaMA). Generating text with transformers. Exploring different decoding strategies (greedy search, beam search, top-k, top-p sampling). |
| 5. Fine-Tuning LLMs for Custom Tasks            | When to fine-tune vs use zero-shot learning. Fine-tuning GPT/BERT models on domain-specific data. Using LoRA and PEFT (parameter-efficient fine-tuning).                                            |
| 6. Embeddings & Vector Databases for LLMs       | Understanding text embeddings (OpenAI Embeddings, Sentence-BERT). Storing embeddings in vector databases (FAISS, ChromaDB, Pinecone). Retrieving similar documents with embeddings.                 |
| 7. Prompt Engineering & Optimization            | Understanding zero-shot, few-shot, and chain-of-thought prompting. Designing better prompts for LLMs. Using LangChain to structure complex prompts.                                                 |
| 8. Building Applications with LLMs              | Using LangChain to build AI-powered applications. Implementing retrieval-augmented generation (RAG). Integrating LLMs with APIs, chatbots, and search.                                              |
| 9. Deploying & Scaling LLM Applications         | Hosting LLM applications using FastAPI, Streamlit, or Flask. Optimizing cost and performance of LLMs. Running LLMs locally vs using OpenAI/GCP/Azure APIs.                                          |
| 10. Ethics, Bias, and Responsible AI            | Understanding hallucinations in LLMs. Addressing bias and fairness in generative AI. Implementing safety mechanisms in AI applications.                                                             |
| 11. Hands-on Project                            | Building an AI-powered chatbot, content generator, or summarization tool. Deploying a real-world application using an LLM.                                                                          |
