### ðŸ”§ What is Jenkins?

**Jenkins** is an open-source **automation server** used to **automate the building, testing, and deployment** of software projects.

Think of it like a robot that watches your code and takes care of repetitive tasks like:

* Running your tests every time you push code
* Building your application
* Deploying it to servers

Jenkins is widely used in **DevOps** and **CI/CD pipelines**.

### ðŸ”„ What are CI/CD Concepts?

| Concept                         | Meaning                                                                                                                                       |
| ------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **CI (Continuous Integration)** | Developers frequently commit code to a shared repo, and Jenkins (or similar tool) automatically tests and builds it. This catches bugs early. |
| **CD (Continuous Delivery)**    | Automatically prepares your application for deployment after each successful build. Manual approval is optional.                              |
| **CD (Continuous Deployment)**  | Goes one step further and **automatically deploys** code to production after testing. No manual steps.                                        |

### âœ… Why Jenkins is Used?

| Reason               | Explanation                                                                                    |
| -------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Automation**       | Automates repetitive tasks like build, test, deploy.                                           |
| **Plugins**          | Over 1800 plugins to integrate with tools like Git, Docker, Kubernetes, Terraform, Slack, etc. |
| **Open Source**      | Free and backed by a large community.                                                          |
| **Custom Pipelines** | Use Groovy-based `Jenkinsfile` to define complex pipelines as code.                            |
| **Scalable**         | Can distribute work across multiple machines using agents/nodes.                               |
| **Cross-Platform**   | Works on Windows, Linux, Mac â€“ integrates with any language or tech stack.                     |

### ðŸš€ Example Flow with Jenkins in CI/CD

1. Developer pushes code to GitHub.
2. Jenkins triggers build:

   * Clones the repo.
   * Installs dependencies.
   * Runs tests.
3. If tests pass:

   * Builds a Docker image.
   * Pushes to a container registry.
   * Deploys to staging or production.
